# autoshares

Somehow or other, my network shares suffer from the pecular problem where switching networks will induce them to lag Windows Explorer horribly. This throws code at the problem and proactively adds/removes the shares on network changes.

Windows Vista and above.

Configure everything in config.ini. Program will probably silently crash if your config.ini is wrong.
